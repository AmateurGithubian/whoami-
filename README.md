# whoami-
this is my first repository. :)
well as the name of the repoistory suggests this repoistory is nothing but a short introduction of myself.the reason this is being done by me is that to explore this awesome community of GitHub.

Who am i?
Hello i'm Armaan! , i'm a high-school student(a typical i should say).i'd see myself spending most of my time in the internet,i had my intrest in computers since i was a 4 year old. i loved computers and i still do. however i just had the 'desire' for computers and not the 'passion'(by this i mean building stuff with computers e.t.c). 

i guess i had developed this passion during these qurantine days. for now i'm a amateur pythoneer(i'm still learning btw). and i once after i complete python, i might get myself into other branches aswell.


well i hope i answered the question:)


Why did i create this Github page?
As i said i'm still a student.Who still learning. this profile is my place to upload stuff that i make . to put in simple words- its a personal progress documenation.
but i also have intrests in contributing something to the  community.



Thanks for spending your time here!

print("Have a good day!")
